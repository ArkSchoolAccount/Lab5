Introduction:
The main program first takes the user's inputted name, then their inputted age. The age is converted into integer, but inputting anything besides an integer results in an error.

The program then compares the user's entered age with the integer 90. If the user is older than 90, it will print out "Hi (name). You're old." Otherwise, it will print out "Hi (name). You're statistically probably still old."
